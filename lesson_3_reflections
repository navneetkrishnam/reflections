1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repo when there are multiple developers working on the same code.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will help in pulling only the necessary changes rather than every change made on the Git.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks clones GitHub repos in GitHub.
Clones replicate GitHub repos in Local.
Branches are a part of repos.
