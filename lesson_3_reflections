1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repo when there are multiple developers working on the same code.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will help in pulling only the necessary changes rather than every change made on the Git.
